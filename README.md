# "watchmen", a service monitor for node.js

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/iloire/WatchMen.png?branch=1.x)](http://travis-ci.org/iloire/WatchMen)

- monitor service health (outages, uptime, response time warnings, avg. response time, etc) in your servers (`http`, `smtp`, etc).
- use the database of your choice. Data **storages are pluggable**. At this time, only [redis](http://redis.io) storage is available, but it is pretty easy to create and plug your own. There are plans to support `couchdb` and `mongodb` in the short term.
- **ping types are pluggable**. At this time, `http` (includes `https`) and `smtp` (tcp connection check) are available.
- watchmen provides **customizable notifications** if service is down, the response time is over a predefined limit, etc..
- the code base aims to be small, simple and easy to understand and modify.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies first:

    $ npm install

## Configuration

### a) Define hosts and services to be monitored:

You need at least one service for each host. Define the ping service type for each host or service.

Most of the properties can be defined either at host or service level. Service level properties will be prioritized.

```js
//-------------------
//config/hosts.js
//-------------------

//example of http ping for a host with 2 url's
{
  name:'letsnode blog',
  host: 'letsnode.com',
  port:80,
  ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval (in seconds)
  ping_service_name: 'http', //if ping_service_name is not defined, 'http' is used by default
  failed_ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval if site is down (in seconds)
  enabled: true, //enables/disables this host
  alert_to: ['ivan@iloire.com'], //emails to alert if site goes down.
  warning_if_takes_more_than: 700, //miliseconds. alert if request takes more than this
  remove_events_older_than_seconds : 60 * 60 * 24 * 10, // remove events older than (seconds)
  services : [
    {
      name : 'home',
      method: 'get',
      url : '/',
      //expected status code and expected string to be found in the response (otherwise will fail)
      expected: {statuscode: 200, contains: 'A blog about node.js and express.js'}
    } ,
    {
      name : 'contact page',
      method: 'get',
      url : '/contact',
      expected: {statuscode: 200, contains: 'Contact page'}
    }
  ]
} ,

//example of smtp ping
{
  name:'mydomain',
  host: 'mydomain.com',
  port:25,
  ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval (in seconds)
  ping_service_name: 'smtp',
  failed_ping_interval: one_minute,
  enabled: true,
  alert_to: ['ivan@iloire.com'], //emails to alert if site goes down.
  warning_if_takes_more_than: 700, //miliseconds. alert if request takes more than this
  services : [
    {
      name : 'my smtp server'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Authorization settings (since 2.2.0)

Since version ``2.2.0`` you can restrict services or hosts to certain users (authentication works using passportjs's GoogleStrategy).

Simple use the ``restrictedTo`` option and provide the list of emails with access to that particular service or host.

```js
{
  name:'letsnode blog',
  host: 'letsnode.com',
  port:80,
  ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval (in seconds)
  ping_service_name: 'http', //if ping_service_name is not defined, 'http' is used by default
  failed_ping_interval: one_minute, //set ping interval if site is down (in seconds)
  services : [
    {
      name : 'home',
      method: 'get',
      url : '/',
      expected: {statuscode: 200, contains: 'A blog about node.js and express.js'},
      restrictedTo: ["admin@yourdomain.com"] // you can apply restrictions at a service or host 
    }
  ],
level
} ,
```

As with the other configuration options, ``restrictedTo`` can be used at service or host level.

Make sure you set the right hostname in the ``config/general.js`` file so the OAuth dance can be negociated correctly:

```js
public_host_name: 'http://watchmen.letsnode.com/', // required for OAuth dance
```

### Ping services

#### HTTP

Using http ping service, you can also check for a) certain http status code or b) a certain text in the response stream.

##### Main properties:

- `host.host`
- `host.port`
- `host.ping_service_name` (use 'http', although it is the default value)
- `service.method` (get/post)
- `service.url`
- `service.expected` (expected status code, expected text to be found in response)

#### SMTP
##### Main properties:

- `host.host`
- `host.port`
- `host.ping_service_name` (use 'smtp')

### b) Define Postmark and notifications settings:

```js
//-------------------
// config/general.js
//-------------------

module.exports.notifications = {
  enabled: false, //if disabled, no email will be sent (just console messages)
  to: 'ivan@iloire.com',
  postmark : {
    from: 'ivan@iloire.com',
    api_key : 'your-postmark-key-here'
  }
}
```

### c) Configure the storage provider

```js
//-------------------
// config/storage.js
//-------------------

module.exports = {

  //---------------------------
  // Select storage provider.
  // Supported providers: 'redis' (only redis at this time)
  //---------------------------
  provider : 'redis',

  options : {

    //---------------------------
    // redis configuration
    //---------------------------
    'redis' : {
      port: 1216,
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      db: 1
    }
  }
};
```
### Storage providers

#### Redis
##### Installation and configuration

1. get redis from [redis.io](http://redis.io)
2. launch the server:

```
    $ redis-server redis.conf
```
### d) Add custom logic

Example: log in the console and send email if there is an outage:

```js
//-------------------
// server.js
//-------------------

watchmen.on('service_error', function(service, state){

  /*
  //Do here any additional stuff when you get an error
  */
  var info = service.url_info + ' down!. Error: ' + state.error + '. Retrying in ' +
      (parseInt(state.next_attempt_secs, 10) / 60) + ' minute(s)..';

  console.log (info);


  if (state.prev_state.status === 'success' && config.notifications.enabled){
    email_service.sendEmail(
        service.alert_to,
        service.url_info + ' is down!',
        service.url_info + ' is down!. Reason: ' + error
    );
  }
});

```

# Running and stopping watchmen

Make sure you have `redis-server` in your `PATH`

    $ npm start
    $ npm stop

Or if you want to run the services separately:

    $ redis-server redis.conf
    $ node server.js
    $ node webserver/app.js


# Tests

Run the tests with mocha:

    $ npm test


## History

**2.2.0**

- Added service/host authorization with passportjs and GoogleStrategy.

**2.1.0**

- Fix issue #7. Make load_services async so eventually services can be fetched form a database or remote server.

**2.0.0**

- Upgrade to Express 4 (requires Node 0.10 or later), hence bumping to 2.x.
- Bump ejs
- Remove dynamic helpers

**1.1.1**

- Persist table sorting options in localStorage.
- Improve styling and responsiveness.
- General code cleanup.
- Display date of oldest event stored in the database in details view.
- Bump redis, moment and ejs.
- Some other minor changes.

**1.1.0**

- Delete events older than a certain threshold (configurable in a per-host basis)
- Bump jQuery to 1.11.1
- Bump Handlebars to 2.0.0
- Bump bootstrap to 3.2.0
- Responsive design based on bootstrap

**1.0.alpha1 Major changes and improvements**

- **Storages** are now pluggable. `redis` storage is used by default but you can create your own : `couchdb`, `mongodb`, text file, etc (see lib/storage).
- **Ping services** are also pluggable now. So far you can use `http` and `smtp` (`smtp` is just checking tcp connection right now). You can create your own or improve the existent ones easily.
- Watchmen daemon now inherits from `events.EventEmitter`, so you can instanciate it and subscribe to the events of your choice (service_error, service_back, etc) to implement your custom logic (see server.js).
- [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) has been removed. Watchmen uses handlebars now instead. Faster, simpler code, and avoids some client side memory leacks.
- Client side is using [moment.js](http://momentjs.com) for rendering dates.
- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) routes now are handled on /routes
- [Mocha](visionmedia.github.com/mocha/ ) is used for unit testing. Mocked storages and ping services are used.
- Configuration is now spread in separate files, under the /config directory
- Better reporting web interface. **Uptime statistics**. Outages count, warnings count.

**0.9**

- Major refactor, improved performance.
- Added tests and mocked objects for testing.
- Separate files for request, utils and watchmen library.

**0.8**

- Removed logging to file.
- Bug fixing when storing event. Needed to add port to redis key to make it unique.
- Added callback when sending email to registered problems in delivery.

**0.7**

- **Targets node 0.6.x**
- Added [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com) for view model binding.
- Auto **async refresh** main page.
- **Filter** by name in main page.
- Added counter (hosts up and down).
- UI Improvements.
- Tablesorter sorts status and time tags.
- Added Google Analytics.

**0.6**

- Added current status info (site is up or down) to database.
- Added icons to display status (disable, error or ok).
- TableSorter jQuery plugin orders by status by default.

**0.5**

- Added expiration time to event records.
- Stores avg response time for each url.
- Warns if response time > limit.
- Multiple recipients in notifications.
- Removed "retry_in" option. Watchmen works in a smarter way now.
- REDIS backend.
- **Web UI to display reports** (express.js app using REDIS backend).

**0.4**

- Be able to disable entries in config file at url level
- When site is back, displays and logs information about how long the site has been down.

**0.3**

- Logs "site down" and "site back up" messages to a file (logs in a different file per host)
